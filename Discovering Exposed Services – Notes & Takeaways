Service Discovery – Clean, Generic Notes from the Provided Output (No flags, no room-specific names)
1. Start with the Basics
Bashnmap 10.49.144.20

Scans only the top 1000 most common TCP ports
Quick way to spot obvious services (SSH on 22, HTTP on 80, etc.)
Often misses the interesting stuff

2. Never Stop at 1000 Ports – Scan Everything
Bashnmap -p- --script=banner 10.49.144.20

-p- → scans all 65 535 TCP ports
--script=banner → grabs the first few bytes services send (version detection without -sV)
Revealed two hidden services:
FTP running on a non-standard high port (21212)
Custom application listening on another high port (25251)


3. Interact with Non-Standard Services

FTP on weird port → still works with the normal ftp clientBashftp 10.49.144.20 21212
anonymous login → ls → get file
Custom TCP service → use Netcat, the universal network Swiss army knifeBashnc -v 10.49.144.20 25251Send HELP, ?, or just hit Enter – many home-grown services spill useful info immediately.

4. Remember UDP Exists
Bashnmap -sU 10.49.144.20

UDP scanning is slower and noisier, but sometimes the only open UDP port (e.g. 53/DNS) holds secrets
Once you find DNS running, query it directly:Bashdig @10.49.144.20 TXT anything.you.want +short

5. Once You’re Inside – On-Host Enumeration Beats External Scanning
Bashss -tunlp          # modern replacement for netstat -tunlp

Shows every listening socket and which address it’s bound to
Services on 0.0.0.0 → reachable from the network
Services on 127.0.0.1 → only accessible locally (MySQL 3306, internal web servers on 8000, etc.)

6. Localhost Services Are Low-Hanging Fruit
Example: MySQL on 127.0.0.1:3306
Bashmysql -D database_name -e "show tables;"
mysql -D database_name -e "select * from interesting_table;"
Many production databases allow password-less root login from localhost → instant data access after you get a shell or web console.
Core Takeaways (Universal Truths)

Always scan all TCP ports (-p-) and at least top UDP ports
Banner grabbing is free intel – use it early
Netcat is your best friend for anything that isn’t HTTP/FTP/SSH
UDP port 53 often leaks data via TXT records
Once inside, ss/lsof + localhost clients (mysql, psql, redis-cli) are gold
Services love hiding on high ports – never trust the “top 1000 only” mindset

Keep these steps in muscle memory and you’ll never get stuck on “I see open ports… now what?” a
