🔐   Key Takeaways & Commands
🧠 How Attackers Recover Weak Passwords

They don’t break encryption — they guess passwords.

Dictionary attacks: try known/common passwords (rockyou, leaks).

Mask attacks: brute-force with patterns (e.g., ?l?l?l?d?d).

GPU cracking: massively speeds up attacks.

Detection: high GPU usage, cracking tools executed, wordlists accessed.



📄 2. PDF cracking
pdfcrack (dictionary attack)
pdfcrack -f flag.pdf -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

John (via pdf2john)
pdf2john.pl flag.pdf > pdfhash.txt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pdfhash.txt

🗜 3. ZIP cracking
zip2john → john
zip2john flag.zip > ziphash.txt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ziphash.txt

fcrackzip
fcrackzip -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt flag.zip

🎯 4. Mask / brute-force (example patterns)

Format example:
?l?l?l?d?d → 3 lowercase + 2 digits
(used by hashcat / john incremental)

Hashcat example mask:
hashcat -a 3 -m <hashmode> hash.txt ?l?l?l?d?d

🕵️ Detection Indicators (very short)

Processes: john, hashcat, fcrackzip, pdfcrack, zip2john, pdf2john.pl.

CLI flags: --wordlist, -w, --mask, -a 3, rockyou.txt.

Files touched: john.pot, .hashcat/hashcat.potfile.

GPU spikes: nvidia-smi showing hashcat/john.

🛡 Response Playbook (minimal)

Isolate host

Collect artifacts (process list, GPU stats, wordlists, hashes)

Preserve working directory + history

Check what was decrypted

Verify if authorized

Rotate credentials + enforce MFA
